Pyqtgraph's Graphics Items
==========================

Since pyqtgraph relies on Qt's GraphicsView framework, most of its graphics functionality is implemented as QGraphicsItem subclasses. This has two important consequences: 1) virtually anything you want to draw can be easily accomplished using the functionality provided by Qt. 2) Many of pyqtgraph's GraphicsItem classes can be used in any normal QGraphicsScene.
